This is a space invaders type game made for learning purposes. I used this project as a way of getting used to Python, object-oriented programming, and researching libraries such as pygame and json since most of my university coding experience is in procedural programming and building nearly everything from scratch. It's nice to not reinvent the wheel sometimes and just apply your ideas.

Features: score tracking with a high score system, multiple lives and dynamic difficulty

To run the game, you must have the lastest version of [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your system along with the pygame module (pip install pygame). If you have them installed already, just run alien_invasion.py however you want (as an executable or with Python3)

**Controls**:
- start the game with space, p or by clicking the button
- arrow keys to move the ship left and right
- space to shoot
- q to exit the game

Your objective is to shoot down the aliens on screen and get the highest score you can.

The game will get progressively harder as you clear out the waves of aliens, but you will also get a bit faster over time.
